## Built off the Apprentice Web Starter Kit

This is a barebones development server that offers SASS compiling w/ [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer). It supports [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io) for live reloads and interaction sync across browsers.

## Apprentice Edition

This version of the web starter kit removes some additional CSS that's typically included in the main [Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/8thlight/web-starter-kit).

## Includes Starter ITCSS

This project includes a starter [ITCSS structure](https://github.com/8thlight/design-styleguide#scss) complete with variables and normalization.

## Installation

> `npm install`

## Starting the Server

> `npm start`

By default, the server will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can access the Browsersync settings UI at `http://localhost:3001`. This will enable you to activate settings such as:

- Network Throttle to simulate lower speed connections.
- Remote Debug for CSS including element outlines, depth outlining, and a grid overlay.
